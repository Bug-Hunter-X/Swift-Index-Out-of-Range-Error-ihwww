This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift programming: index out of bounds errors.  The `bug.swift` file contains code that attempts to access an array element using an index that's outside the valid range of the array's indices, leading to a runtime crash. The solution in `bugSolution.swift` shows how to prevent this error using appropriate checks and safe indexing techniques.
